# Tracker
A simple tracker which is used to track operations and represent them as an emoji percentage bar.

This has hardcoded values for the emojis at present.
This is just to give others an idea of how to implement a "tracker" for Flux's and update a message with the progress using animated and static emojis.

Also, I don't use Github and never learned how to use it in the first place, so yeah.
